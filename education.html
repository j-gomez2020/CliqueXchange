    <section> The design is simple. In order to understand the design, it is important to understand the rich history that has embolden our directive.
        Rotating savings and credit associations (ROSCAS) and Accumulating savings and credit associations (ASCAS) attract and generate millions of dollars a year carrying ancient lines in many countries. Today, these models enable the shadow economy (unrecorded and untaxed) in ways that benefit the community.</section>

    <h3>But, how are funds safeguarded?</h3>
        <section> Studies have shown that less than 0.003% never pay back money owed in fear of social sabotage. We, of course, are inspired by these numbers, however, will use 182 megabit/second conversion to safeguard any data transfers (including money). </section>

    <h3> Why aren’t people doing it currently?</h3>
        <section>Well, they are. There is eMoneyPool, MAF, and even crowdfunding. However, many who have previously sought to serve these associations have fallen short due to lack of creative aims to scale. Turning a community-style operative into a lucrative business model will not work. Our design, patent-pending, is created to help one another financially while creating better incentives rather than attaching interest rates to small dollar loans. </section>

    <h3>How is CliqueXchange different?</h3>
        <section>Our platform uses the same principles set by ROSCAS and ASCAS but integrates them into a community free-market exchange.  It will enable individual users to save together, build credit together, and potentially lend to friends and family, without the hassle of privacy or resentment.This method works! For the past 4 years, the co-founders have been unknowingly testing this model and safeguarding their own small dollars using “good-faith of friendship” as a platform. </section>
