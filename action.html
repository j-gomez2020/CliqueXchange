        The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)  has already outlined underbanked Solutions: “...providing access to loans with interest rates below 36%, getting people to save, and helping people to build credit.” This is exactly what CliqueXchange will implement with a bright team of intuitive Engineers, captivating Entrepreneurs, strong Financial Analysts, and dedicated Socially Responsible individuals.
        The Plan to create scalable platforms will continuously be safeguarded by our mission to serve users, not rival competitors in the industry. We are well aware of what is currently being offered. However, we want to shift the way our users will view their own financial health by having them learn from their own habits. By incentivizing the users and their social-cultural community, we have designed our business model to scale cultural groups, or cliques, to help each other, and inadvertently the platform. We promote social allies as financial allies instead of the traditional institutional incentivization within the current banking system. </article>
